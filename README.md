# Surveys
A lil Google Forms clone, maybe with some additional features :)

## Todo
[ ] Register all models in the admin cp
[ ] Get account registration working in the frontend
[ ] Get JWT auth working properly
  [ ] Login
  [ ] Logout
  [ ] Clicking Logout over and over doesn't keep creating new tokens
  [ ] Refresh token works
[ ] Make sure all legacy code works
[ ] Rewrite the basic frontend - reference previous work and BlogAPI, but don't just copy from it
[ ] Let anon (and/or users) view a survey in the frontend
[ ] Let anon (and/or users) create a survey in the frontend
[ ] Let users take a survey in the frontend
[ ] Write tests for all of this
[ ] Learn Selenium
[ ] Write frontend tests for all of this
[ ] Learn Tailwind.css, create some nice styling
[ ] Create some kind of control panel for people who have made surveys
  [ ] Most basic: show how many people have taken each survey, and how many people have chosen each response for each question
  [ ] Something nicer
